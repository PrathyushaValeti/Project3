             When introduced, the Nexon became the country's first made-in-India, sold-in-India model to register a five-star rating from Global NCAP
             High safety standards, modern features and futuristic design back its success.
             Almost all Tata cars are doing well for the brand, but the Nexon is doing exceptionally well for the brand.</font></p>
